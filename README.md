# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of breast cancer in patients based on diagnostic features. It includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, model development, evaluation, and visualization to provide accurate and interpretable predictions.

## Key Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with clear visualizations
* Implementation of predictive models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines
* Evaluation using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
* Interface to classify new patient data based on input features

## Dataset

The project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore data and run predictions.

## Usage

* Explore and analyze the dataset
* Train and evaluate predictive models
* Use the prediction module to classify new patient data

## Technologies

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn for predictive modeling
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## License

This project is released under the MIT License.
